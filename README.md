# Philosopher's stone (Minecraft Fabric mod)

"Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise"

The philosopher's stone is a legendary  alchemical substance capable of turning base metals such as copper or iron into gold. It is also called the elixir of life, useful for rejuvenation and for achieving immortality. For many centuries, it was the most sought-after goal in alchemy. 

In Minecraft, after years of research, I discovered its secret recipe:

Legends always have a gist of truth, but they rarely tell the whole truth, so I tested the capabilities of the newly discovered philosopher's stone. 

There is one more item to help you at the very beginning of a new game: the wooden bucket.
It is similar to a normal bucket, but made of wood, can hold only water, and does not interact with cauldrons.

## For developers

Quite often, when I start learning programming on a new platform, I find even the simplest examples too complicated.
Tutorials, written by experts, with years of experience programming on that platform, sometimes forget how difficult those first step are.
This is why I decided to make my first, very simple, Minecraft mods publicly available.
